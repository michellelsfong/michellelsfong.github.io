    <p>This tool can help you get started with setting your hourly rate. This calculator is only intended to be a starting point, speak with a CPA to be sure the tax rates are correct for your case.</p>
    <p>What is your pre-tax salary? No commas please :')</p>
    $<input type="text" id="salaryInput" value="100000">
    <button onclick="calculate();">Calculate</button>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>After a 20% tax, your salary's take home pay is $<span id="salaryYearlyTakehome"></span>
    <br>That's $<span id="salaryMonthlyTakehome"></span> a month.
    <br>

    <br>Self employment tax is 15%, so you'd only need to make $<span id="selfemYearlyProfit"></span> to match your salary.
    <br>Not including holidays, that's $<span id="selfemMonthlyProfit"></span> a month.
    <br>Or, $<span id="selfemWeeklyProfit"></span> a week.
    <br>Or, $<span id="selfemDailyProfit"></span> a workday.
    <br>

    <br>Privately, your minimum hourly rate is $<span id="selfemHourlyRate"></span>. A rule of thumb is to double this amount,
    to account for benefits like insurance, software, time between projects, etc.
    <br>
    <br>To work 5 days a week and make the equivalent of your salary, consider a $<span id="selfemDailyProfitDouble"></span>/hr rate.
    <br>To work 4 days a week and make the equivalent of your salary, consider a $<span id="selfemWork4Days"></span>/hr rate.
    <br>To work 3 days a week and make the equivalent of your salary, consider a $<span id="selfemWork3Days"></span>/hr rate.
